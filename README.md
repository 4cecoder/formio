A combined form and API platform for Serverless applications
===============================
Form.io is a revolutionary combined Form and API platform for Serverless applications. This repository serves as the core Form and API engine for https://form.io. This system allows you to build "serverless" data management applications using a simple drag-and-drop form builder interface. These forms can then easily be embedded within your Angular.js and React applications using the
```<formio>``` HTML element.

Walkthrough video and tutorial

For a walkthrough tutorial on how to use this Open Source platform to build a Serverless application, watch the video [0 to M.E.A.N in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gTYkPFhPI)

Manual Installation (Node + MongoDB)
-------------------
To get started you will first need the following installed on your machine.

  - Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
  - MongoDB - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
    - On Mac I recomment using Homebrew ```brew install mongodb```
    - On Windows, download and install the MSI package @ https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
  - You must then make sure you have MongoDB running by typing ```mongod``` in your terminal.

Running with Node.js
-------------------
You can then download this repository, navigate to the folder in your Terminal, and then type the following.

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will walk you through the installation process.  When it is done, you will have a running Form.io management
application running at the following address in your browser.

```
http://localhost:3001
```

The installation process will also ask if you would like to download an application. If selected, the application can be found at the following URL.

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You can also see the contents of the application (for modification) within the ```app``` folder which exists inside of the folder where you downloaded this repository.

Development
--------------------
To start server with auto restart capability for development simply run this command:
```
npm run start:dev
```

Deploy to Hosted Form.io
--------------------
If you wish to deploy all of your forms and resources into the Form.io Hosted platform @ https://form.io, you can do this by using the Form.io CLI command line tool.

```
npm install -g formio-cli
```

Once you have this tool installed, you will need to follow these steps.
 - Create a new project within Form.io
 - Create an API Key within this project by going to the **Project Settings | Stage Settings | API Keys**
 - Next, you can execute the following command to deploy your local project into Hosted Form.io.
 
```
formio deploy http://localhost:3001 https://{PROJECTNAME}.form.io --dst-key={APIKEY}
```

You will need to make sure you replace ```{PROJECTNAME}``` and ```{APIKEY}``` with your new Hosted Form.io project name (found in the API url), as well as the API key that was created in the second step above.

This will then ask you to log into the local Form.io server (which can be provided within the Admin resource), and then after it authenticates, it will export the project and deploy that project to the Form.io hosted form.
